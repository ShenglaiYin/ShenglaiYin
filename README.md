- 👋 Hi, I’m @ShenglaiYin, a passionate ecologist. I study disease ecology, especially the avian influenza and its interactions with migratory birds.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning coding, from R to Netlogo, trying new statistical tricks such as mechine learning and structural equation model, etc. I am also very interested into writing, now trying to squeeze time for practicing. I might open a blog on Github very soon.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on all academic topics, especially on animal movements, avian influenza virus, zoonotic disease, nature conservation, etc. 
- 📫 I am also on Twitter: @Shenglai_Y.
